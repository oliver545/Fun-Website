        <h2> Weekly A</h2>
        <h4> 01/24/23</h4>
        <p>
            So far this week has been a much needed review for me. 
            I have a little bit of prior experience in html and css from a previous class. 
            The shortcuts that were mentioned during class were very helpful and will hopefully make my life easier when coding! 
            To recap this week, some big things we learned were how to:
            <ul>
                <li>create an html and css file</li>
                <li>use w3 schools</li>
                <li>add color and style other items through css</li>
                <li>add images and links</li>
            </ul>
            These were all great refreshers for me. 
            I did not use w3 schools when I was learning html & css, so I will make sure to make great use out of this resource. 
            On Friday, I gave a presentation about the Internet in general. 
            Something that I thought was interesting was Microsoft Bob. 
            In design, its always said that the more intuitive a design is the better. 
            However, Microsoft Bob is a great example of how you can go too far with intuition and rely on the "old" way of things too much. 
            Having a healthy balance between intuition and practiciality is always important. 
            Overall I'm very excited about the things I will learn in this class! Here are some images that I enjoy looking at:
